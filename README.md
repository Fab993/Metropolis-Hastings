# Metropolis-Hastings
Simple implementation of the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm for the island hopping problem. Read [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolis%E2%80%93Hastings_algorithm) for a quick intro to the Metropolis-Hastings Algorithm.
Read [here](https://rpruim.github.io/Statistical-Rethinking/Examples/Metropolis.html) for a nice explanation of the island hopping problem. There, you will also find an alternative solution.
